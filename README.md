# hello-world
The first GitHub tutorial for my profile.

Hello! 👋🏽 I'm Tierra!
I am currently learning Javascript and Python.

My goals for the future are working in Cybersecurity, the FinTech industry or Web 3.0. 

I'm willing to adapt and learn new things to level up my skills.

I like iced coffee, spicy chips 🌶️, and dark chocolate 🍫.
